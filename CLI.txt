Why Use the Command Line?

Both the GUI(Graphical User Interface) and CLI(Command Line Interface) are ways you can interact with your computer.
But when it comes to the command line, once you learn the commands, it is faster and more powerful to navigate and use your computer. This is why many programmers prefer the command line.



What is the shell?

When we speak of the command line, we are really referring to the shell. The shell is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the operating system to carry out.
Almost all Linux distributions supply a shell program from the GNU Project called bash.
The name “bash” is an acronym for “Bourne Again SHell”, a reference to the fact bash is an enhanced replacement for sh, the original Unix shell.

date - displays current date and time

df - see the current amount of free space on our disk drives
free - display the amount of free memory



Flags
=====

Most command line utilities take parameters using flags.
Flags usually come in short form (-h) and long form (--help).
Usually running CMD -h or man CMD will give you a list of the flags the program takes.
Short flags can usually be combined, running date -u -R is equivalent to running date -uR or date -Ru.

tab - auto fill (very handy)
